    The crowd, suddenly there where there was nothing before, is a mysterious and
    universal phenomenon. A few people may have been standing together -- five, ten
    or twelve, nor more; nothing has been announced, nothing is expected. Suddenly
    everywhere is black with people and more come streaming from all sides as though
    streets had only one direction.
